The supported platforms are Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, Windows Mobile and 32-bit
DOS (go32v2).

Generally you need the latest stable version of the Free Pascal Compiler, which
currently means version 3.0.4. Note that Windows 95/98/ME and NT 4.0 are still
supported, when this library is compiled with FPC 2.6.4. However, using
FPC 2.6.4 isn't guaranteed to work for any other platforms, besides Windows.

 - Compiling the library:
Before starting make sure the FPCDIR environment variable is set correctly.
For example: (windows, fpc version 3.0.4, default install dir)
Note that there must not be spaces in the FPC path.

  set FPCDIR=c:\fpc\3.0.4

Also you cannot compile the library if there are elements from the library
already in your FPC units path.  Rename the following files:
units\i386-win32\graph\ptcgraph.ppu
units\i386-win32\graph\ptcgraph.0
units\i386-win32\graph\ptccrt.ppu
units\i386-win32\graph\ptccrt.0
units\i386-win32\graph\ptcmouse.ppu
units\i386-win32\graph\ptcmouse.0
And all the files in the driectory: units\i386-win32\ptc\

To compile the library type:

  fpcmake -r
  make

Then you can do:

  make examples

And then try to run the programs in the demos/ and examples/ dirs.

If compiling the library fails, make sure you're using the GNU make and not
some other make! (e.g. GNU make is usually called 'gmake' on *BSD)

'make -v' should report:
  GNU Make version x.xx.x, ... etc. :)

On Windows and DOS this is the 'make' that comes with Free Pascal.


To compile the library for x64 Windows
  Rename the following files:
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptcgraph.ppu
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptcgraph.0
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptccrt.ppu
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptccrt.0
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptcmouse.ppu
units\x86_64-win64\graph\ptcmouse.0
And all the files in the driectory: units\x86_64-win64\ptc\
  
  Then type:
  fpcmake -r -Tx86_64-win64
  make CPU_TARGET=x86_64 OS_TARGET=win64
